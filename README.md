# alejandra-cuadra
Local artist web application.

This application will be live soon on domain name alejandracuadra.com (check out her current site - her work is amazing!), showcasing a local artist's beautiful work. Right now it is still in development to polish up a few things, but if you'd like to have a look at the code, go ahead!

I use React on the front-end, with Node on the backend and MongoDB as a database to hold all of the artwork.

Thanks!
