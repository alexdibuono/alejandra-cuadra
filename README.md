# alejandra-cuadra
This is a web application for a very talented local artist!

This application will be live soon on alejandracuadra.com (her old site is still live for the time being - feel free to check out some of her amazing work!). Right now this app is still in development while I polish up a few things, but if you'd like to have a look at the code, go ahead!

I use React on the front-end, with Node on the backend and MongoDB as a database to hold all of the artwork. There is a compose page for her to conveniently dump photos and descriptions of new exhibits as she pleases.

Thanks!
